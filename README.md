Kilo "Worst Website" Challenge
5. Judging Criteria
Submissions will be evaluated based on how terrible, inconvenient, and ugly the website is. The Kilo Team will have the final judging input, but there may be a mix of both Kilo Team and community judging. This is subject to change throughout the challenge. Criteria include:
How ugly and visually offensive the design is
How inconvenient and frustrating the user experience is
Creativity and originality of the terrible design choices
Overall presentation and entertainment value
Judging decisions are final and at the sole discretion of Kilo.
