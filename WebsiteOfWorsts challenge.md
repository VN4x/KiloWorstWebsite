*Kilo "Worst Website" Challenge*

*5. Judging Criteria*

*Submissions will be evaluated based on how terrible, inconvenient, and ugly the website is. The Kilo Team will have the final judging input, but there may be a mix of both Kilo Team and community judging. This is subject to change throughout the challenge. Criteria include:*

*How ugly and visually offensive the design is*

*How inconvenient and frustrating the user experience is*

*Creativity and originality of the terrible design choices*

*Overall presentation and entertainment value*

*Judging decisions are final and at the sole discretion of Kilo.*



Green main, text  darker green with ligther green 2px stroke

Main Colour pallette,but not limited to:

\#100100100

\#608040

\#802080

\#e0c040

\#000000

\#e0c0e0



Attached is design of front page
id if possible left eye is blinking occasionally and beam is flowing. "HELP" and arrows in right footer is blinking rapidly pace and linked to https://archive.org/
squares in middle are changing colors randomly

we want the text ("This is loading, wait please. you can start game when you see here") in the middle of the screen to be scrolling from left to right very slowly, so that red link ("this link") will be visible only after 40 second of opening this page. 

When "This link" becomes visible it is flashingly changing size from 0,3em to 1,8em once a second. Mouse cursor is now 40 x 70 px rectangle filled pink #e0c0e0.

Pressing "This link" with mouse cursor opens popup "now play" which is openable only via keyboard pressin either "E" "L" or"9". After pressed "E" "L" or"9" popup "Proceed to NXT LVL" which needs to be clicked with mouse cursor. It opens next page (pg2).





Build the exact front page (Pg1) for the "Worst Website" challenge using the uploaded design image as visual reference.



Requirements (match the screenshot + text description exactly):



COLORS (main palette, not limited to these):

\- #100100100

\- #608040 (main green)

\- #802080 (purple)

\- #e0c040 (yellow/gold)

\- #000000 (black)

\- #e0c0e0 (pink)



Text: darker green with lighter green 2px stroke (-webkit-text-stroke: 2px lighter-green).



LAYOUT \& ELEMENTS:

\- Two cartoon eyes at top with red beams pointing downward (left eye blinks occasionally with CSS/JS animation; red beam has flowing animation).

\- Black "Loading" progress bar in the middle.

\- Scrolling text across the screen: "THIS IS LOADING, WAIT PLEASE. YOU CAN START GAME WHEN YOU SEE HERE THIS LINK" (green text, "THIS LINK" in red).

&nbsp; - Scrolls from left to right VERY SLOWLY so that the red "THIS LINK" only becomes visible after exactly 40 seconds of page load.

&nbsp; - Once visible, "THIS LINK" flashes font-size between 0.3em and 1.8em once per second (CSS animation).



\- Bottom row of colored squares (E, green, purple 9?, yellow, black, purple L) — these squares randomly change background color every 1–2 seconds using colors from the palette (JS).

\- Purple footer bar with left-pointing arrows (<<<<) and blue "HELP" button on the right. "HELP" + arrows blink rapidly (opacity toggle every 0.3–0.5s) and the HELP links to https://archive.org/.



INTERACTIONS:

\- Custom mouse cursor: 40px wide × 70px tall solid pink rectangle (#e0c0e0). Hide default cursor and follow mouse with a fixed-position div.

\- Clicking "THIS LINK" opens a centered modal popup that says "now play".

\- This popup can only be advanced by pressing keyboard keys E, L, or 9 (any one of them). On keypress, replace it with a second popup "Proceed to NXT LVL".

\- Clicking "Proceed to NXT LVL" (with the custom cursor) navigates to pg2.html (create a placeholder page for now).



Make the page as ugly, inconvenient, and frustrating as possible while exactly following the design. Use embedded HTML + CSS + JS (no external files except the HELP link). Use Comic Sans or similarly bad fonts where possible.



Output the complete code and preview instructions.
